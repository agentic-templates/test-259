# Writing guide

This guide covers everything written for the project: docs, issues, pull requests, commit messages, code comments, error messages, and replies and reports to the maintainer. The aim is text that a reader understands the first time they read it. The examples in this guide use a made-up expense tracker.

## Know your reader

- Write for a reader who knows the project's field and reads once. The reader is new to the project too, even in a pull request that the maintainer reads, but not in a reply or report to the maintainer. For someone who uses the project, the field is the kind of work it helps with, such as keeping track of spending. For a developer, the field also includes the project's language and tools.
- Leave out what the reader already knows and what the code already shows.
- Leave out how something works inside, and how one tool differs from another, unless the reader must act on it.
- Start with what the reader came for: what they can do, what changed or what went wrong.

## Use plain words

- Use everyday words for the actual action. Write "adds the expense to the month's total", not "processes the expense".
- Replace vague verbs such as "handles", "deals with" and "manages" with the verb for what happens.
- Keep a technical term only when it is the precise name for the thing. Explain it where it first appears, unless people in the reader's field use it every day.
- Use one term for one thing, everywhere. Don't switch to a synonym for variety.
- Don't use metaphors or marketing words such as "seamless", "powerful" or "blazing fast".
- Cut filler such as "simply", "just", "basically" and "note that".
- When you give a single example, pick the case that applies to most readers.
- Replace a vague judgment with the fact behind it. Write "imports 10,000 expenses in 2 seconds", not "fast".

For example, in a README for people who use an expense tracker:

- Not "The import pass hashes each row and drops collisions."
- But "When you import a file, the app skips the expenses it already has."
- Not "The app handles foreign currencies differently."
- But "The app leaves expenses in a foreign currency out of the total and lists them below it."

## Write clear sentences

- Put one idea in each sentence. "The app totals the expenses for each month, and it can export them as a spreadsheet" holds two ideas, so it becomes two sentences.
- Keep the words that link ideas, such as "because", "so", "but" and "unless". "The app leaves an expense in a foreign currency out of the total, because it doesn't know the exchange rate" is one idea with its reason. Give a reason only when the reader needs it to act correctly.
- Don't use semicolons in prose. Don't join two sentences with a dash either. Write two sentences.
- Say who does what. Write "The app deletes the expense", not "The expense is deleted". Leave out the actor only when it is unknown or doesn't matter.
- In a step the reader follows, put the condition first: "If the command reports that the disk is full, free at least 2 GB and run it again."
- Use the present tense for what the software does.
- Give exact numbers with their units, and exact names, commands and paths.

## Claim only what is true

- Claim only what the project delivers today. Never invent results, demos, benchmarks, users or quotes.
- In docs and READMEs, mention planned work only when an open issue with the `ready` label describes it, and link to that issue.
- State what the project can't do, not only what it can.
- Say only what you verified. If you didn't run a check, don't say that it passed.

## Write error messages

An error message says what failed and what the reader can do about it. When a limit or rule was broken, the message names it and includes the value that broke it.

- Not "Invalid file."
- But "bank.csv has 60,000 rows, and the limit is 50,000. Split it into two files and try again."
- Not "Error: ENOENT"
- But "Can't find the file ~/Downloads/bank.csv. Check the path, or choose another file with --file."

## Write issues, pull requests and commit messages

- Write for a reader who hasn't seen your conversation, notes or session. Don't refer to any of them, or to what happened in an earlier session, such as a build run on a given date.
- An issue's body describes what to build now. When a decision, an answer or a new detail changes the issue, rewrite the sentences it changes, so that the body reads as if it had been written that way from the start.
- Write a pull request for a developer who joins the project later, not only for today's reviewer. Say what changed and why. Don't list the changed files.
- Say how you checked the change: the checks you ran and what they showed. That includes the review described under "Review a changed page with a fresh reader" in [docs/pages.md](pages.md). Name any check from AGENTS.md that you skipped, and say why.

## Write replies and reports

- Start with what the maintainer must decide, or with what changed.
- Show the result, such as the new wording, instead of describing the change.
- Give each decision with the option you recommend.
- Leave out the steps you took, unless the maintainer or a guide asks for them.
- Leave out evidence and details that the maintainer doesn't need to decide. Give them when asked.
